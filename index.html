<p>
    A movie or film is a type of visual art that uses images and sounds to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch movies to entertain themselves or to have fun. Some movies can make people laugh, but other movies can make them cry, or make them feel afraid.
    Most movies are made so they can be watched at home or on a movie screen at movie theaters. Movies are shown in movie theaters a few weeks or months after or before the movie is released. Movies can be marketed using media. Movies are shown on pay television or cable television, or are sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. Movies can also be downloaded or streamed. Some movies are shown on television broadcasting stations.
The Simple English Wiktionary has a definition for: movie.
Movies are filmed with movie cameras or video cameras. Movie cameras take pictures very quickly, and they usually take 24 or 25 pictures, or frames every second. When a movie projector, a computer, or a television shows the pictures at 24 frames a second, it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are moving. Sound is usually recorded at the same time as the pictures are, but sometimes they are added later. The sounds in a movie are usually people talking, the soundtrack, and sound effects. In the 20th century the camera used photographic film.
Most movies start to be made when a screenwriter writes a script, which is the story of the movie with dialogue and words and things that the actors will say and do. A producer hires people to work on the movie and gets the money that will be used to pay for the actors and the equipment. Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by asking investors to give money to them. Some producers work for a movie studio, but other producers work by themselves.
Actors and directors read scripts to learn what to say and what to do. The actors learn the words from the script that they will say in the movie, and learn the things that the script tells them to do. Then, the director tells the actors what to do and a cameraman takes the film of them saying the words with a film camera.
When the filming is done, an editor makes the film play after each other, which makes a story. Audio engineers and sound engineers record music and singing and combine it with the film. When the movie is done, many copies of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto film reels. Then the reels are sent to movie theaters. A projector shines a very bright light through the film, and people sitting in a dark room see it on a big screen.

<p>
<b>1. Action</b><br>
Action films traditionally contain dangerous situations and high-stake risks, and many require the use of physical stunts, fight choreography or disaster sequences. The high-energy elements in these films can aid in achieving audience escapism because viewers often appeal to the story of a hero who struggles against all odds and still achieves victory. The films in this category share a common theme, which is most of their content is action-oriented. They often include having some sense of danger through a majority of their scenes. Some familiar subgenres of the action genre are superhero, disaster and espionage.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Adventure</b><br>
Adventure films typically involve a journey, and some may include a pursuit. They might also have action-oriented scenes like action films, but the travels and conquests of the main characters primarily define them. This emphasis on a character's adventure can help the audience imagine themselves in those experiences. You can create an adventure film in any setting, as long as your narrative involves a journey.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Comedy</b><br>
Comedies are films intended to make the audience laugh through their use of exaggeration of language, action or characters who add humor to a situation. Many comedies use everyday situations in their stories to provide a funny commentary on a common life frustration to relate to the audience. Two common comedy formats are comedian-led and situational comedies. There are many subgenres of comedy, including romantic comedy, spoof, parody, satire, sitcom, sketch comedy and mockumentary.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. Drama</b><br>
Films in the drama genre often include realistic settings and defining conflict between one or more characters and themselves, others or forces of nature. Dramas usually have the intention to provoke powerful emotions in the audience by including societal ills, such as addiction, poverty, racial prejudice, sexual inequality, classism or corruption. There are several subgenres within drama, including melodramas, docudramas and medical, legal and philosophical dramas.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. Horror</b><br>
The purpose of horror films is to cause an audience to feel frightened or have a sense of dread. They usually center their stories on unsettling situations, alarming events or the audience's fears. Many include elements that alert primal fears, like nightmares, vulnerability, alienation and fear of death or injury, which aim to attract and repulse the audience. Some subgenres of horror include supernatural, found footage, slasher, occult, vampire and monster films. These can have a variety of settings, ranging from realistic to wildly imaginative.

</p>
<p>
<b>6. Romance</b><br>
Films in the romance genre typically involve intimate relationships and a journey of the love between the main characters. The conflicts that occur during the pursuit of intimacy or love often drive the narrative in these films. The main characters usually confront obstacles, such as hardships, illnesses, infidelity, family problems or common relationship issues, and in many romance films, they ultimately reunite to create their perfect life together. Their love is a narrative device that acts as a shield to help them overcome challenges and develop the journey of their love.
</p>
<p>
<b>7. Science fiction</b><br>
Science fiction movies are often a blend of science and imagination. You're likely to see films in this genre that portray advanced technology and scientific developments, and they normally contain special or visual effects. Directors often choose from several observable sciences, like astronomy, physics, geology and biology to provide a sense of logic in a film's proposed reality. Some common themes in science fiction films are the consequences of knowledge, the nature of humanity in existential crisis and interpreting science-based conspiracies.

</p>
<b>8. Fantasy</b><br>
Fantasies are films directors set in imaginary worlds that have little or no representation of reality. These movies often include magical, mythological and extraordinary elements, and they can transcend physical laws and have endless possibilities. The main characters in a fantasy film usually undergo a mystical experience that requires superhuman aid. Many fantasies derive from fairy tales, myths or legends and incorporate unique characters and odd phenomena in their stories.
